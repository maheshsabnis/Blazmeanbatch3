# Testing React.js apps
- "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.4",
    - Jest Integration with React Application to Test DOM
    - The DOM will be generated in-memory
    - This is depending on the react library for DOM Rendering and Virtual DOM 
- "@testing-library/react": "^11.1.0",
    - THis provides an inbuilt functionality for managing the DOM generation and Mounting it for Testing
        - Uses the react-dom module
            - The 'act' method
                - Load the DOM in the Memory
                - Monitor all DOM Changes based on Data Updates and the Events
- "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10",
    - Monitor all events dispatched on DOM elements generated in Memory

- Process of Writing the Test
    - Use following classed from the 'react-dom' package
        - render()
            - Method to RTender the DOM
        - unMountComponentAtNode()
            -  release the DOM from the memory and free memory from DOM
    - react-dom/test-utils
        - The  'act' method
    - Add a new folder in the 'src' folder and name it as 'test'
        - FileName for test MUST be  [COMPONENT-FILE-NAME].test.js    
    - To generate the code Coverage Report use the following command
        - npm run test -- --coverage 
            - npm run test will call 'react scripts test', this will internally call 'jest'
                - and then it will call 'jest --coverage'     
- React Component's Testing Features
    - Test the Component
    - Test events
        - To test an event on the HTML element use 'dispatchEvent()' function and pass an Event Object to it
    - Test Relationships across Components    
        - If enzyme is used then We MUST have an enzyme configuration and an adapter that will check if the parent component or a single (shallow) is tested or the whole DOM tree is tested (mount)             
        - We need the Enzyme Adapter (for React 17+), the Official adapter is not present so we have to use the following unofficial adapter

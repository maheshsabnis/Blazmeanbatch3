# Working With Microservices

1. Docker 
    - Download the Docker desktop
    - OS MUST support Hardware based Virtualization
2. Use the standard Docker Images
    - https://hub.docker.com
    - We have various standard images to create the image for our application
3. The Application MUST have following 2 files
    - dockerfile
        - Contains Script for Creating an Image for our application
    - .dockerignore
        - The file that contains the configuration that will not be used when the docker image is created         
4. Docker Commands for Login and listing images and containers
    - Uses the Docker CLI
        - docker
    - Login on docker.com
        - docker login
            - Ask the User Name and Password
            - This is MUSt for Pushing and Pulling Images to and from https://hub.docker.com
        - docker logout
            - Logout from Docker
    - List All docker images on the local Machine
        - docker images
    - Each Image Runs into its Container
    - Command to List all Containers
        - docker ps
    - Command to List all Running Containers, they ar running and using resources like CPU, Memory and Network
        - docker ps -a
5.  Docker Commands to Build images, Running Images inside the container
    - Build an image, This Command MUST run from the path where 'dockerfile' is present. The command will read all configurations e.g. Base Image, Files to Copy, Dependencies to install, Port to expose, command to run the application, etc. from the dockerfile
        - docker build . -t [IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG]
            - The . means the current path to read dockerfile
            - The -t, the tag name, the name for image and its version
            - The IMAGE-NAME, the name of the image. This MUST be in lower case    
            - The TAG, this is the Version Name, Version Number or any other Unique value
        - e.g.
            - docker build . -t myimage:v1
    - Run the Image
        - Running the image will create a container. The image will be loaded into the container and then it will be executed
            - docker run  -p [PORT-ON-LOCAL-MACHINE]:[PORT-EXPOSED-BY-CONTAINER] [IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG] --name=[CONTAINER-NAME-IN-WHICH-IMAGE-WILL-BE-LOADED]
                - If the the image is having Web App /  REST API then the container will expose the port so that http call will be accepted by it so we need to map the 'PORT-ON-LOCAL-MACHINE' to the 'PORT-EXPOSED-BY-CONTAINER' using '-p'   
                - The '--name' is the CONTAINER-NAME, this MUST be lower case
        - Make the container running in background Continuously
            - docker run -d -p [PORT-ON-LOCAL-MACHINE]:[PORT-EXPOSED-BY-CONTAINER] [IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG] --name=[CONTAINER-NAME-IN-WHICH-IMAGE-WILL-BE-LOADED]  
    - Stop Container
        - docker stop [CONTAINER-NAME] | [CONTAINER-ID]
            - Unload the container and release resources e.g. CPU, Memory, Port, etc.
    - remove Container
        - docker rm   [CONTAINER-NAME] | [CONTAINER-ID]
            - Container MUST be stopped before removing it
    - Remove Image
        - docker rmi [IAMGE-NAME]:[TAG] | [IMAGE-ID]
            -  Container MUST be stopped and deleted before removing image                                    
    - Pushing Image to Docker repository
        - https://hub.docekr.com
        - Tag the image using respository-name
            - e.g. is the repository name is 'xyz' the tag the image as 
                - docker tag [IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG] xyz/[IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG]
        - Use the PUSH command
            - docker push xyz/[IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG]
                - The push command will read the repository name from the image name, then connect to repository and then push the image in the repository                  
       - Pull image from the repository 
        - docker pull [IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG]           

# Microservices
1. It is an architecture where the big-complex application is divided into small cohesive set of services
    - Each Service is
        - Independent
        - Containing its own logic
        - Containing its own database
        - Containing its own Endpoint
    - Each service is decouples from other service
    - Services cannot /  should not communicate with each other directly over Http
    - Services Communication can takes place using one or all of the following mechanisms
        - Using Messaging Services
            - RabbitMQ
            - Simple Queuing Service on AWS
            - Azure Service Bus
            - Any other messaging service provider
        - Using Distributed Cache
            - Redis Cache 
            - Any other Cache provider service
    - If the application has multiple Microservices then instead of exposing them on different HTTP Endpoints, use the following mechanism for Single Point of Communication
        - Using Application Gateways
            - Using Code e.g. Express-Session
            - Cloud Gateways
                - Application Gateway by AWS, Azure, Google
            - Configuration based Gateways e.g. Ingress        
        - The Multiple Services MUST be deployed on Clusters    
            - Kubernetes
                - Minikube
                - Microk8s
                - Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
                - Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
                - Google Kubernetes Service (GKS)
            - The cluster offers Application Gateway using Ingress            
2. If using multiple Microservices on premises, then use one of the following
    - Docker-Compose    
        - The inbuilt service for deploying, executing and managing multiple microservices
        - Host Services in separate containers
        - Expose Ports from  each container
        - Manages the network resources internally
    - We need the 'docker-compose.yml' file for building images and hosting them 
        - The compose needs to read the dockerfile for each microservice
        - The docker-compose.yml file MUST be on the root of all microservices
    - The 'docker-compose.yml' file contains following settings
        - The 'version', the version of compose that will be used to parse the file using docker-engine
            - The current version is 3.9
        - The 'services'
            - This is a collection of all Microservices to be build, hosted and executed
                - The 'SERVICE-NAME', the name of the service
                    - The 'build', the folder path where 'dockerfile' exists
                    - The 'ports', ports exposed from container that is hosting the service  
                    - The 'links', (Optional) the image on which the current service is linked with
                        - e.g. if the service is using the cache, then we need to configure the cache image separately  
                    - The 'depends_on', (Image) the image on which the service is depending on e.g. database image     
    - To run the docker-compose, go to the path where the docker-compose.yml file is present and then run the following command
        - docker-compose up
            - Read DockerFile
            - Validate it
            - Build an image
            - Configure Network Resources if there multiple services    
        - docker-compose down
            - This will stop all containers
            - All resources will be released    
    - This is good for on-premises apps but for enterprises make use of kubernetes         
    - Kubernetes on Premises (Recommended)                                 
3. Practices for creating Microservices
    - Make sure that the Cloud-Based database is used by Microservice for Data Read/Write operations
    - Do not use Database Image
    - For the messaging use the Enterprise Messaging Service Provider (generally on cloud), do not use image

# ES 6 Programming
- Its is new JavaScript  Standard for the Modern JavaScript Full-Stack Apps
- Contains Following Features
    - Variable Scopes
    - DataTypes
    - Collections
        - Array
        - Set
        - Map
    - String Interpolation aka Templates
    - Object Mutations aka Object Spread aka rest parameters
    - Arrow Operators
    - Iterators using for..of loop
    - Object Oriented Programming
    - Asynchronous  Programming using Promises
    - Patterns for Proxy and Reflection
    - Sequence Generators and Iterators
- Languages those are built on concepts of ES 6
    - Modern JavaScript aka High-Level JavaScript aka ES 6/7/8/9/10/next
        - Primarily used in Node.js, React.js, VueJS, and most of the Modern JS Libraries and Frameworks
        - DataTypes are implicit based on the initial value assigned to variable
    - TypeScript
        - Language by Microsoft
        - Primarily used in Angular development by Google
        - Supports DataTypes explicitly
        - Based on C# and conceptually more close to JAVA
        - Preferred Language for Building Modern "Micro-Front-End Apps", using React and Angular and VueJS at a time on Browser
            - React, Angular and VueJS can use TypeScript for effective code sharing      
    - Dart
        - Language by Google
        - Extensively used by Google for Web PlugIns for Optimized UI 
- ES 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 as standard and not a library
    - Standard  Library
    -   ES 6    ES2015 (Foundation with Modern Features)
    -   ES 7    ES2016 (Used with Promises) 
    -   ES 8    ES2017 (Used with Asynchronous Programming)
    -   ES 9    ES2018 (Features Mostly for Server-Side Apps development) 
    -   ES 10   ES2019
    -   ES 11   ES2020 (Under Development)
    -   ESNext                 

# ES 6 Application Development
- Project Configuration
    - Use the 'babel' Transpiler
        - This will be used to transpile (Compiled Transformation aka Transforming after Compilation) ES 6 to Browser-Compatible JavaScript
    - Create a package.json
        - Important Sections of package.json
            - scripts
                - This is a JSON object that contains commands as Key and its value as the program to run or execute
                - The Commands those are used to build, test and run package (or current application)
                    - 'build', 
                        { 'build': 'babel myfile' }
                            - the command is 'npm run build' OR 'npm build'
                                - This will invoke 'babel myfile' command and execute it
                    - 'start'
                            - {'start': 'node myfile.js'}
                            - npm run start or npm start        

            - dependencies
                - List of all packages used during the execution time on the server for the current application 
                    - These packages will be installed using the following command
                        - npm install --save [PACKAGE-NAME]
                            - e.g. npm install --save express
            - devDependencies    
                - List of all packaged used during the development of the current application
                    - These packages will be installed using following command
                        - npm install --save-dev [PACKAGE-NAME]
    - For ES 6 Development use the following Mandatory Packages
        - @babel/cli
            - The Command line interface used for Transpiling ES 6 into JavaScript 
            - The CLI MUST be installed for Global Scope and Current Application Scope
                - npm install -g @babel/cli
                    - Once installed in Global Scope it can be used for Command Line execution for Transpilation
        - @babel/core
            - The Package that is used to contain ES 6 code specifications
            - Used by Transpiler to validate the code during ES Source Code Compilation  
            - Install this package in Global and Application Scope
                - npm install -g @babel/core  
        - @babel/preset-env
            - The package used for Project Environment Settings for Code Environment check e.g. Array or collection declaration, variable declaration, ect.
            - This is used by Transpiler
        - @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties
            - Support for ES 6 Class properties e.g. get and set
        - @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods                
            - Support for ES 6 class Private Methods and Class Members

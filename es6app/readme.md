# ES 6 Application Development Environment Configuration
- Project Configuration
    - Use the 'babel' Transpiler
        - This will be used to transpile (Compiled Transformation aka Transforming after Compilation) ES 6 to Browser-Compatible JavaScript
    - Create a package.json
        - Important Sections of package.json
            - scripts
                - This is a JSON object that contains commands as Key and its value as the program to run or execute
                - The Commands those are used to build, test and run package (or current application)
                    - 'build', 
                        { 'build': 'babel myfile' }
                            - the command is 'npm run build' OR 'npm build'
                                - This will invoke 'babel myfile' command and execute it
                    - 'start'
                            - {'start': 'node myfile.js'}
                            - npm run start or npm start        

            - dependencies
                - List of all packages used during the execution time on the server for the current application 
                    - These packages will be installed using the following command
                        - npm install --save [PACKAGE-NAME]
                            - e.g. npm install --save express
            - devDependencies    
                - List of all packaged used during the development of the current application
                    - These packages will be installed using following command
                        - npm install --save-dev [PACKAGE-NAME]
    - For ES 6 Development use the following Mandatory Packages
        - @babel/cli
            - The Command line interface used for Transpiling ES 6 into JavaScript 
            - The CLI MUST be installed for Global Scope and Current Application Scope
                - npm install -g @babel/cli
                    - Once installed in Global Scope it can be used for Command Line execution for Transpilation
        - @babel/core
            - The Package that is used to contain ES 6 code specifications
            - Used by Transpiler to validate the code during ES Source Code Compilation  
            - Install this package in Global and Application Scope
                - npm install -g @babel/core  
        - @babel/preset-env
            - The package used for Project Environment Settings for Code Environment check e.g. Array or collection declaration, variable declaration, ect.
            - This is used by Transpiler
        - @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties
            - Support for ES 6 Class properties e.g. get and set
        - @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods                
            - Support for ES 6 class Private Methods and Class Members    
    - Creating the Babel Resource COnfiguration, this will be used by the Babel Transpiler for ES 6 to JavaScript Transpilation
        - The name of the file will be  '.babelrc'
            - Configure the Presets and the Plugins      
        - The .babelrc is a resource configuration used by the Babel Transpiler to compile the ES 6 code that contains the Private Methods and  get,set Properties in ES 6 class
- The Command for the Transpilation
    - babel [Source-File].js -o [Target-File].js
        - Source-File.js is ES 6 Source Code
        - Target-File.js is The Transpiled file
        - -o is output
# ES 6 Programming
- Scope Definition for the variable
    - The 'let' keyword
    - This is Block-Scope declaration
        - e.g. let x;
            - The 'x' will be only accessible in declaring Block, e.g. if, for..loop
- Template String AKA String Interpolation
    - a Simpler Syntax for String Concatenation
        - Syntax:
            - `${str1} ${str2}`;
                - str1 and str2 are string, they will be concatenated into a single string object
                - Eliminate a need of using '+' operator for concatenation 
                - ${}, a syntax the represents an expression that will be evaluated to string interpolation
                    - Template String is also know as a process of building a 'Single immutable string object that accepts multiple strings in it'. 
- New Iteration Loops
    - The 'for..of' loop, that internally uses the ES 6 Iterator to create a readable sequence of values
    - This will start reading the sequence from the first index and will auto-advance to the last record in the sequence and return them
        - for(let record of collection){......}
            - The 'record' is a record or entry from the collection
- A Simplification of the Callback Function using an 'Arrow Operator'
    - Array.sort(function(a,b){return a - b;});
        - function(a,b){return a - b;}
            - function without name
    - For a Function Without Name or a Callback function, the ES 6 have provided the new syntax which is called as an 'Arrow Operator'
        - Syntax
            - =>
            - Array.sort((a,b)=> {return a-b;});            
- Array Collection and its New Methods
    - Iteration Methods
        - forEach(callback function)
            - Used to read Records from an Array
            - forEach() does not return any data from an iterating Array
        - map(callback function)
            - Used to Read Records from an Array 
            - map() can be used to return modified value or processed values from iterating array with same size as of the iterating array
                - While processing records from iterating array, if the condition of processing record does not match and undefined value will be returned for that record in output array, and the output array will be of same size of iterating array
        - filter(callback function)
            - Used to return an output array based on reding records from array by filtering each record based on condition match
        - find(callback function)
            - Return a first match record based on condition
    - Manipulation methods               
        - join()
        - reverse()
        - reduce() 
            - Cases discussed for Data in Array 
                - CASE 1: Summation of numeric values in array
                    - [1,2,3,4,5,6]
                        - looping or iteration
                            - Point to 0th index read-it and advance-to to next record upto max-length 
                        - The iteration must process on two-values of array from left-to-right and keep reducing the array size till end-of-array does not reach    
                            - [1,2,3,4,5,6] , 0th iteration
                            - [3,3,4,5,6], 1st iteration 1 and 2 are reduced after processing  
                            - [6,4,5,6], 2nd iteration 3,3 are processed and array is reduced
                            - [10,5,6], 3rd
                            - [15,6], 4th
                            - [21], 5th                     
                - CASE 2: Frequency of a word/character in string array
                - CASE 3: Grouping data in Array
- ES 6 Collections
    - Well organized way of storing the data
    - Requirements for collections as follows
        - Data to be stored in Key:Value Pair
        - Data to be stored with Unique Key
        - Data to be stored with Complex Structure (Needs received from NoSQL)
    - Set();
        - Used to store the data as unique entry into the Collection
            - The duplicate entry will not be accepted
        - Used to Store any type of data
        - Methods
            - add(), values(), keys(), has(), clear() clear all entries from set
            - delete(), delete the specific entry from the set
        - We can store Objects in the Set()    
        - WeakSet()
            - Used to store only objects
    - Map();            
        - Used to Store data in Key:Value pair
        - Key is always unique
            - If Key is Duplicated, the earlier will be overwritten by the latest one
        - Value can be any data type
        - Methods
            - set(), get(), has(), clear(), delete(), values(), entries(), forEach(), values()
        - Properties
            - size
        - WeakMap()
            - Key and Value both are objects
- ES 6 Object Oriented Programming
    - Support for Classes with following in ES 6
        - Constructor()
            - the 'constructor()' is a Standard functions
        - Class Members
            - They are defined as public members with 'this.' prefix inside the 'constructor()' function    
        - public Methods
            - default to ES 6 
        - private methods
            - # prefixed methods
            - Local to class
            - accessed in the class using 'this.'
        - public data members (ES 9+)
            - These can be declared directly at class level w/o using 'this.' prefix  
            - NOTE: This is introduced because 'React.js has a public "state" object at class level'  
        - private members
            - # prefixed variable
            - local to class
            - accessed inside the class using 'this.'    
        - properties
            - get and set methods (ES 7)
            - the 'get' and 'set'
        - static methods
            - The 'static' keyword
    - No Abstract class by default, but can be defined inside the Object Constructor using 'new' moniker  
        - To prevent an instance creation check the 'new.target', if it is same as the class to be instantiated then throw type error and prevent the JavaScript from parsing the 'new' statement that is used to create an instance 
            - The 'new' is JS object for instance creation
            - The 'new.target' is a property that returns the name of the class which is to be instantiated
        - Throw Either 'Error' or 'TypeError' for exception or error message    
    - The derivation can be implemented using 'extends' keyword
        - Derive class has an access of all public members of base class
        - If the base class constructor has parameters then in derive class we can use 'super()' inside the constructor of derive class to access base class constructor
    - If the base class and derived class have same methods names then using an instance of derive class, the method from derived class will be accessible
        - In ES 6 OOPs there is no UpCasting and DownCasting    
    - The method overloading is not directly possible
        - If The method with same name in class exists then the later will overwrite earlier one 
        - Can be implemented using indirect coding 
            - an 'arguments' array
                - This is a standard JavaScript array that reads numbers of arguments to a method
            - using 'rest-parameters' aka 'object spread'
                - The rest-parameters also used in case where method needs variable numbers of parameters
                - Syntax
                    - function xyz(...p)
                        - The 'p' is an array object that has variable length
    - the 'class' is a keyword
        - No Keywords for 'public', 'private' and 'protected'               
- Rest Parameters
    - AKA Object Spread ...obj
    - Used to build an immutable object in which additional properties will be added at runtime
        - Instead of re-declaring an object, we can directly add new properties or data in existing object
        - Syntax
            - let obj1 = {...obj0, x:1, y:1};
                - The obj1 will be having an schema of obj0 and with additional properties as x and y  
                    - let obj1 =  Object.assign({}, obj0);
                        - a Blank obj1 is created and the schema of obj0 is copied into it
- Date Object    
    - The object that is used to show yer, month, date, hour minutes, seconds, milliseconds

                        - <HTML element class="[c]">       
# CSS 3 Ways of Applying Styles
    - CSS 3 uses an inline JavaScript property and eventing system for following
        - Applying Styles based on Order or position of DOM Element in the tree
            - CSS 3 Position or Indexed based styles where the JS Object Model is used by CSS 3 to locate the element and apply style on it
                - :nth-child(index)
                    - child at a  specifixc index will be read to apply style 
                - :nth-last-child(index)
                    - child from last
                - :first-of-type
                    - first occurance of specific element
                - :last-of-type
                    - last occurance of the specific element     
            - CSS 3 style applied based on the parent-child order
                - element1~elemen2
                    - All element2 occures after element 1           
        - APplying style based on tag+type, tag+class
            - CSS 3 query selector, that is used to extract element based on tag and type as weel as tag and class
                - tag[type="<TYPE>"] {....} 
                - tag.className{....}           
        - Applying Styles based on Mouse or keybord events
            - CSS will listen to a DOM event and then based on  the Event the Style wil be applied
                - :hover, :mouseenter, :mouseleave, etc.
                    - document.addeventListener('mouseenter')
                - e.g.
                    - [selector]:[event]{......}    
        - Applying Styles based on values of attributes of HTML elements
            - The CSS 3 will use JSOM to locate an element basd on its attribute's value and style will be applied
            - The Element will be located based on the pattern
            - e.g.
                - div[class^=myclass]
                    - All div having class value starts from 'myclass'
                - div[class$=myclass]
                    - All div having class value ends with 'myclass'   
                - div[class*=myclass]
                    - All div having class value as 'myclass' anywhere in class attribute value     

                - <div class="myclass myclass1 myclass2" >
